# Audio Visual Person Identification in different strategies on the Voxceleb2 Dataset

Implementation of different strategies in audio-visual person identification on the Voxceleb2 dataset
This repo is the source code of a paper that is under review.
In that paper, we evaluate different strategies in multimodal learning for person identification.
There are different scripts:

SpeakerIdentificationUsingXVectors.xlm ----------> Speaker identification using xVector
Train_pretrained_VggFace2.m ---------> face recognition using VGGFace2 pre-trained net, and sensory fusion with import fused image data.
 feature_fusion_xvector_vggface.m --------> train and evaluate feature fusion mode and, with some changes in the name of the destination layers, work as score fusion.
